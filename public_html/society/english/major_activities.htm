<BR>
(1) Annual meetings , Symposia, Seminars,
etc. <BR>
Å@The Annual Meetings twice a year, in spring
and in fall, are held for three days. During
the meetings, about 180 technical papers
are presented. At the meetings, the latest
studies, findings, and information are exchanged
through technical sessions, lectures and
exhibitions. Planning committee, Research
committee, International Cooperation committee,
and Local chapters offer more than 20 symposia,
seminars or international workshop at suitable
occasions. <BR>
<BR>
(2) Activities ( Role) of Regular Committees<BR>
Å@JILM has nine regular committees and some
branch or ad-hoc committees to accomplish
major tasks in the objectives of JILM. The
roles of regular committees are briefly shown
in the diagram of the JLM Organization. <BR>
Research Committee, one of the regular committees,
has 11 branch committees listed below. All
of the committees consist of researchers
both from industry and academic, and they
present the accumulated results by publishing
research reports or by holding symposia as
occasion demands.<BR>
